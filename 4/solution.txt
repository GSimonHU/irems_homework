1. what a reverse proxy is
- a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network 
- directs client requests to the appropriate backend server
- ensure the smooth flow of network traffic between clients and servers

Commonly used for:
- load balancing: distributing client requests across a group of servers maximizing speed and capacity while ensuring no one server is overloaded
- web acceleration: compress inbound and outbound data, as well as cache commonly requested content, speeding up the flow of traffic between clients and servers
- security and anonymity: intercepting requests headed for your backend servers acting as an additional defense against security attacks

2. what types of reverse proxies there are

Not sure about the question, if its regarding common usage of reverse proxy servers, see 1.
If it is regarding the kind of proxy servers: NGINX, Apache, that I know of and used.

3. analyze and compare Nginx and Traefik
Nginx:
Open-source web server and also used as a reverse proxy.

Additional features:
- Reverse proxy with caching
- IPv6
- Load balancing
- FastCGI support with caching
- WebSockets
- Handling of static files, index files, and auto-indexing
- TLS/SSL with SNI

Traefik:
Traefik is an Edge Router, it intercepts and routes every incoming request and 
knows all the logic and every rule that determine which services handle which requests.

Additional features:
- uses service discovery to configure itself dynamically from the services themselves
- all major protocols are supported and can be flexibly managed with a rich set of configurable middlewares

Compare:
- Traefik is a dynamic load balancer designed for ease of configuration, especially in dynamic environments.
- Nginx is one of the most popular web server among high-traffic websites. As of August 2018, it serves 25.03% of traffic of the top 1 million websites.
