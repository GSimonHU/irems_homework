Postgres cronjob setup documentation

1. Keys need to be generated or imported by gpg for encryption/decryption of db dump
gpg --full-generate-key
OR
gpg --import my-key.key

2. App folder
- backup.sh contains the script that initiates pg_dump which is compressed (gzip) and encrypted (gpg) before outputted in the backup folder
- contab.txt meant to simulate what to put into the actual /etc/crontab, script will run every day 1 minute after midnight

Else:
- backup.sh can be executed via terminal to perform a manual db dumb right away
- backup.sql.gz last modification can be check using ls -la OR stat
